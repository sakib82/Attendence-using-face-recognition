# Attendence-using-face-recognition

It will be my 8th semester project where i will try to create a project which will be able to collect attendence using face recognition. GUI might be included if enough time is available.

Steps : 
    1. take image of face as training set (done 18/12/19)
    2. take current image for match  (done 25/11/19)
    3. take images from video (done 22/12/19)
    4. add a delay while taking picture from video for training
    5. match current image with training images
    6. display person name if face is visible in screen.
    7. add PyQt
    8. Design Button for those tasks.
    9. paper writing.
